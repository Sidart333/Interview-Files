    {
      "question": "You've been tasked with reducing the dimensionality of a high-dimensional dataset using PCA. However, upon visualizing the resulting principal components, you notice that they don't seem to capture much of the variability in the data. What could be the reasons for this, and what alternative dimensionality reduction techniques might you consider?",
