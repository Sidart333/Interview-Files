      "question": "How would you optimize the performance of a slow-performing API call in a React application, and what tools would you use to identify the bottleneck?",
      "answer": " I would optimize the performance of a slow performing API call by using use caching to RITIALs, RITENTENT calls, use peatination, filtering and sorting, batch API requests, implement debons and throttling, optimize payload sizes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you explain the concept of CORS and how you would implement it in a Node.js backend to enable cross-origin resource sharing between a frontend React application and a backend API?",
      "answer": " Cross-origin-dissours, searing is a security mechanism implemented by web browsers, logistics, web pages from making requests toward different domain, and the one that served the page, this prevents malicious scripts from accessing sensitive data on other websites. When a react, untand, learning on one domain tries to access an old GS API, again on a different domain, the browser blocks the request by default due to the same origin policy. CORS provides a V2RLX this restriction, allowing the backend to specify which origins are permitted to access its resources."
    },
    {
      "question": "Write a JavaScript function to implement a simple caching mechanism using the localStorage API to cache API responses and reduce the number of requests made to the backend?",
      "answer": " I vote you as local storage API to cache API responses. I vote you as a sync function which will have a cache key, cache data and cache exciting within if else and try to catch log."

    {
      "question": "Describe the difference between using a monolithic architecture versus a microservices architecture for building a large-scale e-commerce application, and what considerations would you make when deciding between the two?",
      "answer": " Monolithical architecture builds an e-commerce application as a single integrated unit while a microservices architecture breaks it down to a smaller independent services that communicate with each other. For large-scale e-commerce microservices offer great-scale-liability, independent deployment and the ability to evolve the different parts of the application independently. However, they also introduce complexity in development, deployment and management. Monoliths are simpler to develop and deploy initially but can become harder to maintain and scale as application grows."

    {
      "question": "How would you handle authentication and authorization in a full-stack application using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and what measures would you take to ensure the security of user data?",
      "answer": " I would handle authentication and authorization in Nordshaar's application, setting up a Nordshaar's project, implementing authentication with passport.js, implementing token-based authentication with JWT, creating O-Oths for third-party authentication, implementing role-based authorization."
