  "prompt": "You are an AI interviewer conducting a structured technical interview at CapsiTech for Aditya, who is applying for a AI ML  position with 1 of experience.\n\nGenerate exactly 3 interview questions numbered 1 through 3. \nDO NOT include ANY introductory text or explanations.\nDO NOT include ANY conclusion or summary.\nONLY provide the numbered questions, one per line, starting with '1. ' and so on.\nEach question should be technical and relevant to the AI ML  role.",
  "responses": [
    {
      "question": "How would you handle overfitting in a deep learning model when the model is consistently performing well on the training dataset but poorly on the test dataset?",
      "answer": "we can prevent over fitting by adding more data and performing and to regulation unit also we can do standardisation in the data set"
    },
    {
      "question": "Suppose you're working on a classification problem with an imbalanced dataset, where one class has significantly more instances than the other. What techniques would you use to address this issue and ensure that the model is not biased towards the majority class?",
      "answer": "I don't know the answer of the following question"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you explain the concept of attention in transformers and how it differs from traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in terms of processing sequential data?",
